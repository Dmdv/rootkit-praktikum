Rootkit Programming - Exercise 7

You should have received a PDF containing how to compile, insert and use our rootkit module.
Please note that this PDF is not the final writeup. For now, it just serves just as a manual
for you so that you know how to use the module.

Nonetheless, we describe here shortly how to enter a command over the covert communication
channel: Let's assume, you want to hide TCP socket with port 1234. Therefore, you first have
to load the module:

insmod cool_mod.ko

After this, you can just type in commands in the shell. Commands start with "### " (three 
hashes followed by a space). Afterwards comes the command, and - separated by again a space -
optional an argument. The whole command is confirmed by a space again. So, you just enter the 
following into the command line:

###<space>hidetcp<space>1234<space>

Here's a list of commands for the module:

command           argument     example
------------------------------------------------
hideproc          yes, PID     ### hideproc 1234 
unhideproc        yes, PID     ### unhideproc 1234 
hidemodule        no           ### hidemodule 
unhidemodule      no           ### hidemodule 
hidetcp           yes, port    ### hidetcp 1123 
hideudp           yes, port    ### hideudp 123 
unhidetcp         yes, port    ### unhidetcp 1123 
unhideudp         yes, port    ### unhideudp 123 
hidefiles         no           ### hidefiles 
unhidefiles       no           ### unhidefiles 
escalate          no           ### escalate 

Each <space> has to be replaced by a real space.
