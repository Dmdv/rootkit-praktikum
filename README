Rootkit Programming - Exercise 7

You should have received a PDF containing how to compile, insert and use our rootkit module.
Please note that this PDF is not the final writeup. For now, it just serves just as a manual
for you so that you know how to use the module.

Nonetheless, we describe here shortly how to enter a command over the covert communication
channel: Let's assume, you want to hide TCP socket with port 1234. Therefore, you first have
to load the module:

insmod cool_mod.ko

After this, you can just type in commands in the shell. Commands start with "### " (three 
hashes followed by a space). Afterwards comes the command, and - separated by again a space -
optional an argument. The whole command is confirmed by a space again. So, you just enter the 
following into the command line:

###<space>hidetcp<space>1234<space>

Each <space> has to be replaced by a real space. For more information, please look at the manual.
