Rootkit Programming - Exercise 2

You should have recieved the following files (in the archive ex1.tar):
 * README
 * generateSysmap.sh
 * Makefile
 * hello-1.c

We hook sys_read by changing the function pointer in the system call table
to a function hooked_read accepting the same parameters as the original
read function. hooked_read prints out all parameters and the result of the 
original read call.

We considered using try_module_get and put_module to avoid "unallowed unloading"
of our module. However, we ran into some troubles using these, while without 
them, everything seemed just fine. So, we abandoned it. However, you can add it
if you #define USE_MODULE_GET_PUT. That is, you can - before compilation - 
decide, whether you want to use it or not.

Rootkit Programming - Exercise 1

Note that generateSysmap.sh relies on grep and sed to transform system.map 
into a C header file.

Furthermore, for some reason Virtualbox sometimes can't compile the thing from within a shared folder.
